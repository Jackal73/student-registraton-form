# Student 👨🏽‍🎓 Test Scores

1. Carefully read through the each and every girection
2. When you 'connect' the button, **it should only work 1 time. 🤔 🧢** This means that you would need a third argument to `addEventListener`: `{once: true}`. More info [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).
3. Use the _assignment operator_ `=` to update the `textContent` of `"p"` to display the average. Said average would be calculated using _something like_ [the previous examples.](https://dev.to/codefinity/applying-array-superpowers-1kgd) Note that in those examples 👈🏽 the 'data' was just the number. This time, the data is inside an _object literal_ with a 🔑 of `score`...🤔 🧢.
